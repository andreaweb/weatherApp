    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>This is a project for Free Code Camp. It gets your location (according to an API that may not be very precise) and the corresponding weather. The background image will be displayed accordingly.</p>
    
    <h3>I'm not seeing anything...</h3>
    <p>For it to work you must allow your browser to see your location. Sometimes it won't ask, not sure why. Try reloading the page or opening it in another browser.</p>
